## Saturday of Steel
Along with the bi-weekly release schedule I'm bringing back the weekly Sunday of
Steel developer blog posts as Saturday of Steel. On release weeks this post will
be combined with the changelog to form the release blog post as it was last week
for the release of 0.1.2. On the weeks in between will be posts detailing what
has been done that week for the release dropping the next week. This is the
first of these in-between developer blog posts.

## Better Building

For 0.1.3 I wanted to revisit the building mechanic and how the player interacts
with it. The building system has recieved little love since it's initial
implimentation and the cracks were starting to show. As a result I've gone in
and rewrote most of the calculations and made it more mod friendly at the same
time. Below are some screencasts of the new calculations in action.

## A *pointed* difference

In addition to the redone building calculations I've also been starting on a new
building tile. I'll cut straight to the *point.*

Thats right! Triangular walls are coming to SkyOfSteel in 0.1.3! I'm also
experimenting with another triangular surprise ;) For that you'll just have to
turn in next week for the release of 0.1.3!
