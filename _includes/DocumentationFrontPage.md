## Building Custom Gamemodes:
See this example of a minimal gamemode
[here](https://github.com/ForLoveOfCats/ModsOfSteel/tree/master/Minimal) for the
time being, until we have more complete instructions on getting started with
creating custom gamemodes. If one has any questions feel free to drop by the
SkyOfSteel [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Ag5Yckw) and ask in the
#developement channel. Cheers!
